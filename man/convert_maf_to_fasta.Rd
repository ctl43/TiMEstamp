\usage{
convert_maf_to_fasta(
  maf_folder,
  species_file = NULL,
  tree = NULL,
  chrom_size_file,
  folder,
  pattern = "^[^.].*\\\\.maf$",
  buffer_limit_mb = 1L,
  threads = 1L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{maf_folder}{Character. Root folder that contains MAF files (searched recursively).}

\item{species_file}{Character or \code{NULL}. Path to a plain-text file listing
species to retain (one per line). If \code{NULL}, species are inferred from
\code{tree} and the list is written to \code{folder/species_list.txt}.}

\item{tree}{Character. Path to a Newick tree file used to curate the
species list when \code{species_file} is \code{NULL}. Ignored when \code{species_file}
is provided.}

\item{chrom_size_file}{Character. UCSC-style chrom.sizes for the reference assembly.}

\item{folder}{Character. Root output folder. Subfolders named by chromosome will be created.}

\item{pattern}{Character. Regular expression used to find MAF files.
Default is \verb{^[^.].*\\\\.maf$}, which matches plain \code{.maf} files and skips hidden files.}

\item{buffer_limit_mb}{Numeric. Memory buffer before flushing to disk.}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the vector of processed MAF paths.
}
