\title{Overlap-based missing-fraction matrix}
\usage{
compute_missing_portion(x, ref, name = NULL, normalized_by_ref_length = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{GRanges of gap intervals with a \code{labels} factor for species.}

\item{ref}{GRanges or CompressedGRangesList; reference intervals.}

\item{name}{Optional character vector of row names for the output matrix.}

\item{normalized_by_ref_length}{Logical; divide by reference length if \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with rows as loci and columns as species.
}
\description{
Internal helper that computes per-species missing fractions by intersecting
gap intervals with reference intervals and optionally normalizing by reference length.
