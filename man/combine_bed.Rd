\title{Combine and Process BED Files}
\usage{
combine_bed(metatable, folder, large_gap_cutoff = 1000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{metatable}{A character string specifying the path to a metadata table (tab-separated format) 
with columns: (1) BED file paths, (2) corresponding chromosomes, (3) labels (species or groups).}

\item{folder}{A character string specifying the directory where the output `.rds` files will be saved.}

\item{large_gap_cutoff}{An integer specifying the minimum width to classify as a "large gap" (default: 1000L).}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object but saves processed BED data as `.rds` files.
  - Full genomic ranges are saved in `"folder/full_gap/"`.
  - Large gaps are saved in `"folder/large_gap/"`.
}
\description{
This function reads a metadata table containing BED file paths, chromosome information, 
and labels, then imports and processes the BED files into `GRanges` objects.
It stores the processed genomic ranges as `.rds` files for efficient access.
}
\details{
BED records exceeding a specified width (`large_gap_cutoff`) are stored separately.
}
